**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. 

This is a bug tracker. If you need help using the tool, make sure you've read the detailed [README](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt/blob/master/README.md). If something is not in the README that you think would be beneficial, please submit bug requesting the information or, even better, submit a pull request.

If you are running multiple commands or a command group and Seatbelt is crashing before it finishes, consider writing output to a file (`Seatbelt.exe -outputFile=out.txt`) so we can determine the last command that executed before it failed.
