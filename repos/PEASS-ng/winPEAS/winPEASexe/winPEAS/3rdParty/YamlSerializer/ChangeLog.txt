Alpha release of YamlSerializer as 0.9.0.2

* All "_"s in integer and floating point values are neglected
  to accommodate the !!int and !!float encoding.
* YamlConfig.DontUseVerbatimTag is added but the default value is set false.
  Note that !<!System.Int32[,]> is much human friendly than !System.Int32%5B%2C%5D.
* Equality of YamlNode with an unknown tag is evaluated by identity,
  while that of !!map and !!seq node is still evaluated by YAML's standard.
  Note that equality of !!map and !!seq are different from that of object[]
  and Dictionary<object, object>.
* YamlConfig.OmitTagForRootNode was added. Fixed issue #2850.
* Serialize Dictionary<object,object> to !!map. Fixed #2891.
* Modified [126-130] ns-plain-???, [147] c-ns-flow-map-separate-value(n,c)
  to accommodate revision 2009-10-01
* Omit !< > if Tag contains only ns-tag-char, Fixed issue #2813

Alpha release of YamlSerializer as 0.9.0.1

* Removed TODO's for reporting bugs in YAML spec that are done.
* Fixed assembly copyright.
* !!merge is supported. Fixed issue#2605.
* Read-only class-type member with no child members are omitted when 
  serializing. Fixed issue#2599.
* Culture for TypeConverter is set to be CultureInfo.InvariantCulture. 
  Fixed issue #2629.
* To fix Issue#2631
  * Field names and property names are always presented as simple texts.
  * When deserializing, we can not avoid the parser parses some spacial
    names to !!bool and !!null. Such non-text nodes are converted to
    texts at construction stage.
* To fix issue#2663
  * Hash code stored in a mapping node is now updated when the a key node's
    content is changed.
  * Hash code and equality became independent on the order of keys in a 
    mapping node.
  * A mapping node checks for duplicated keys every time the node content 
    is changed.
  * Test results are changed because some of them are dependent on the hash 
    key order.
* The current equality evaluation is too strict, probably needs some adjustment.
* NativeObject property was added to YamlScalar.
* YamlScalar's equality is evaluated by comparing NativeObject.
