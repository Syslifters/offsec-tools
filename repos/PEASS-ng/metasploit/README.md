# PEASS Post Exploitation Module for Metasploit

You can use this module to **automatically execute a PEASS script from a meterpreter or shell session obtained in metasploit**.

## Manual Installation
Copy the `peass.rb` file to the path `modules/post/multi/gather/` inside the metasploit installation.

In Kali: 
```bash
sudo cp ./peass.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/post/multi/gather/
# or
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/master/metasploit/peass.rb -O /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/post/multi/gather/peass.rb
```

Now you can do `reload_all` inside a running msfconsole or the next time you launch a new msfconsole the peass module will be **automatically loaded**.

Description:
  This module will launch the indicated PEASS (Privilege Escalation 
  Awesome Script Suite) script to enumerate the system. You need to 
  indicate the URL or local path to LinPEAS if you are in some Unix or 
  to WinPEAS if you are in Windows. By default this script will upload 
  the PEASS script to the host (encrypted and/or encoded) and will 
  load it and execute it. You can configure this module to download 
  the encrypted/encoded PEASS script from this metasploit instance via 
  HTTP instead of uploading it.

```

The options are pretty self-explanatory.

Notice that **by default** the obfuscated PEASS script if going to be **uploaded** but if you **set SRVHOST it will be downloaded** via http(s) from the metasploit instance (**so nothing will be written in the disk of the compromised host**).

Notice that you can **set parametes** like `-h` in `PARAMETERS` and then linpeas/winpeas will just show the help (*just like when you execute them from a console*).

**IMPORTANT**: You won't see any output until the execution of the script is completed.
