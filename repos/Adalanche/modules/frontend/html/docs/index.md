Adalanche Documentation
</div>

# Overview

This documentation covers both the open source edition and the paid enterprise versions (see [purchasing](installing.md#purchase-the-commercial-version)). Some features are only available in the enterprise version and are indicated with an asterisk.

## How it works

Adalanche reads data and does not change your infrastructure. You can run it with a normal user account and get substantial insight, but complete coverage usually requires elevated collection rights from Active Directory and local machines.

Trying Adalanche is easy with either sample data or data collected from your own infrastructure.
